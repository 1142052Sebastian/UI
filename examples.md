## Example 1 - Installation and first use
This "theme" needs a little work and configuration before you can first use it, but don't worry, we have made it as easy as possible. This "tutorial" shows you, how to setup this "theme" up until the first use. Let's get started!

<details>
<summary>What you should have before you start with installing this theme</summary>

* You should have a HomeAssistant (HA) instance running, preferrably with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) installed and you should know the basics in using HA, eg. how to change settings in your `lovelace` configuration.  
* You have access to your `config` folder of HA. Doesn't matter which way this is, but you need to be able to upload and change files in your config. If you're running `HassOS` or a `supervised install` of HA, we highly recommend the [Samba AddOn]().

<summary>Installing the Samba AddOn in HassOS (or supervised)</summary>
