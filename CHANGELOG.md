# UI-Lovelace-Minimalist CHANGELOG

## Version 1.0.0-beta.2
### Added
* Added a few custom-cards (custom_card_paddy_welcome, custom_card_paddy_waste_collection, custom_card_tpx01_air_condition)

### Fixed
* Fix some typos in readme.md  
* Fix some typos in custom-cards.md  
* Fix `box-shadow` in `card_graph`  
* Fix `chip_icon_state`  
* Fix `chips_icon_double_state`  

## Version 1.0.0-beta.1
### Changed
Actually this version is a major re-write of the previous versions. As the new naming conventions are set, you may need to update your previous code to reflect these changes.  
This is necessary to ease future updates and get some structure in place, eg. for `custom_cards`. For most of the old definitions there are *legacy templates* in place.
